## Usefull Notes
- **Remote vs. Hybrid:** Many Athens-based companies are moving to 1-2 days in office.
- **Salary Insight:** Remote roles for international companies (via B2B) usually pay higher than local Greek contracts.
- **Interview Prep:** Focus on System Design for Senior roles and LeetCode (Medium) for mid-level.
